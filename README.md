We kind of half-assed this one, but I'm still quite proud of it. Very similar to Connect 4, its a cli version of Crazy 8s.
The site is made to look like a blatant rip-off of our Connect 4 site.

A game of 4 AI players can take upwards of an hour or more (just specify 0 players at the start - it's a feature, not a bug)

Made in collaboration with Kevin and Jatin

Original site preserved at https://crazy8.the404.nl (minus one missing screenshot)
